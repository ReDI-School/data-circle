# Water Pump Functionality Prediction

## Project Overview
In this project, you will develop machine learning models to predict the functionality status of water pumps across Tanzania based on a variety of features including location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. This project addresses a critical infrastructure challenge: identifying which water pumps are functional, which need repairs, and which are non-functional to improve maintenance operations and ensure communities have access to clean water.

## Project Goals
1. Develop classification models to predict three target classes:
   - Functional water pumps
   - Water pumps that need repair
   - Non-functional water pumps
2. Analyze which factors most strongly influence water pump functionality
3. Create geospatial visualizations to communicate findings effectively
4. Deploy a simple dashboard to showcase models and insights

## Data Description

### Dataset Source
The data comes from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, which aggregates information about water points across Tanzania.

### Features Overview
The dataset contains 40+ columns representing:
- Geographic information (coordinates, region, basin)
- Technical specifications (pump type, extraction method)
- Management details (installer, funder, payment type)
- Water characteristics (quality, quantity, source)
- Temporal information (construction year, recording date)

### Target Variable
- **status_group**: The operating condition of the waterpoint with three possible values:
  - `functional` - operational with no repairs needed
  - `functional needs repair` - operational but needs repairs
  - `non functional` - not operational

## Project Structure

### Sprint 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (3 weeks)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Handle missing values and categorical variables
- Create geospatial visualizations of water pump distribution
- Analyze relationships between features and pump functionality
- **Deliverable**: EDA report with visualizations and initial insights

### Sprint 2: Model Development (3 weeks)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Train baseline classification models
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate models using appropriate classification metrics
- **Deliverable**: Trained models with documented performance metrics

### Sprint 3: Insights & Deployment (3 weeks)
- Analyze feature importance and model explanations
- Create a Streamlit dashboard with interactive maps
- Document findings and recommendations for maintenance strategies
- **Deliverable**: Interactive dashboard and final presentation
