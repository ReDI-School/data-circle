  - Analyze patterns of missingness and implement appropriate imputation strategies
  - Document rationale for each imputation decision
  
- **Ticket 1.2.2**: Convert categorical variables to appropriate formats
  - Apply encoding techniques (one-hot, label, ordinal) based on variable type
  - Create reusable encoding mappings for test data
  
- **Ticket 1.2.3**: Check for and handle outliers if necessary
  - Use visualization and statistical methods to identify outliers
  - Implement appropriate treatment strategies and document impact
  
- **Ticket 1.2.4**: Normalize/standardize numerical features if appropriate
  - Apply scaling techniques based on data characteristics
  - Create reusable scalers for test data
  
- **Ticket 1.2.5**: Create a data cleaning pipeline that can be reused for test data
  - Build a scikit-learn Pipeline with all preprocessing steps
  - Ensure pipeline handles all transformations consistently

#### Task 1.3: Exploratory Visualization
- **Ticket 1.3.1**: Create visualizations for the distribution of target variables
  - Generate charts showing H1N1 and seasonal vaccination rates
  - Visualize overlap between the two vaccination types
  
- **Ticket 1.3.2**: Visualize relationships between demographic variables and vaccination rates
  - Create grouped bar charts and heatmaps by demographic variables
  - Use appropriate statistical tests to verify observed differences
  
- **Ticket 1.3.3**: Analyze correlations between opinions/behaviors and vaccination decisions
  - Generate correlation matrices and visualize with heatmaps
  - Create charts showing vaccination rates by opinion and behavioral factors
  
- **Ticket 1.3.4**: Investigate geographical patterns in vaccination rates
  - Create maps of vaccination rates by geographic region
  - Compare urban vs. rural vaccination patterns

#### Task 1.4: Feature Analysis
- **Ticket 1.4.1**: Calculate correlation matrix for all features
  - Compute appropriate correlation coefficients for all variable types
  - Generate correlation heatmaps with hierarchical clustering
  
- **Ticket 1.4.2**: Identify potentially redundant features
  - Detect highly correlated feature pairs
  - Recommend which features could be combined or removed
  
- **Ticket 1.4.3**: Conduct preliminary feature importance analysis
  - Use simple models to rank features by importance
  - Compare feature importance between H1N1 and seasonal flu targets
  
- **Ticket 1.4.4**: Document insights about which factors appear most influential
  - Summarize key findings from correlation and importance analyses
  - Identify unexpected or counterintuitive relationships

#### Task.1.5: EDA Report Compilation
- **Ticket 1.5.1**: Summarize key findings and insights
  - Create an executive summary of important discoveries
  - Connect insights to project goals and modeling approaches
  
- **Ticket 1.5.2**: Compile all visualizations with clear explanations
  - Create a visualization appendix with all exploratory plots
  - Ensure all visualizations have proper titles and explanations
  
- **Ticket 1.5.3**: Document preprocessing steps and rationale
  - Create a methodology section describing cleaning approaches
  - Address potential limitations or biases introduced during preprocessing
  
- **Ticket 1.5.4**: Create presentation for Sprint 1 review
